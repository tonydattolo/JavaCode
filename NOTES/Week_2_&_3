Week 2 and 3

TDD Test Driven Development
    Regression Testing - whatever was working before, you haven't broken it
        write first version
        test with 4 possible inputs
        write second version
        test with 4 new inputs

    JUnit
        assert statements

Classes
    methods
    objects
    member variables

Constructors - methods. same name as name of class. arguments change
                example: Rectangle() has 7 different constructors

Getters - get you values of internal member variables
    .getValue(); // Note: getters null parameters

Setters - set values in internal member variables
    .setValue(int x, int y);
    **getters get, setters set

Rectangle(height,width,x,y)
    https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/Rectangle.html

    Rectangle one = new Rectangle(1,1,2,2);
    Rectangle two = new Rectangle(11,11,10,10);

    .toString() //string representation of rectangle

Object() ***all classes come from this. superclass

System.out.println
    **to access static variables, use ClassName.staticVar
    out is a static PrintStream variable of the System class
    Class.staticVar.method
    System.out.format
    printftester.java from book
